In this example we provide a simple C++ interface to the muParser
library and a simple example to illustrate its basic usage.

First of all you have to install muParser (look on the web). The
library is composed by a library file (libmuparser.so) and a set of
header files. You can install either on a standard directory or in a
directory of your choice. *In the latter case you have to modify the
entries in the local Makefile.inc*

The makefile produces an executable and two versions of the library
libMuParserInterface (the static and the shared one).

The executable is called test_Muparser and it is just a simple test of
the interface (and of muParser).

$make
Produces the libraries and the executable (in debug mode)

$make DEBUG=no 
if you want optimised versione

$make static 
produces only static library (DEBUG=no if you want optimized version)

$make dynamic 
produces only dynamic library (DEBUG=no if you want optimized version)

$make test_Muparser 
produces the executable. (DEBUG=No for optimiser).

$make install Installs header files and the libraries in the directory
used for that purpose: $(PACS_ROOT_DIR)/include and
$(PACS_ROOT_DIR)/lib. Necessary for other Examples that uses the
interface.
